1a)
Write a program that takes as input N even integer numbers and prints:

● The sum of numbers given as input.
● The average of the multiples of 3.
● The product of the multiples of 4.
● The product of the negative numbers.

The implementation will only use the while iteration structure.

1b)
Write a variant of the 1a) program which uses only the do while iteration structure.

2)
Write a program that will display the following figures on the screen. The number of lines in the shapes is given by the keyboard.
*       *****               .       *****
**       ****              *.*      *. .*
***       ***             **.**     * . *
****       **            ***.***    *. .*
*****       *           ****.****   *****

3)
Write a program that calculates the following series: The implementation will not include calculations of powers and factorials.

 sin(x) = x - (x^3/3!)+(x^5/5!)-(x^7/7!)+(x^9)/9!...
The value of the variable x is in the interval [0... 2π].

4a)
Write a program that initializes a float variable with the value 0.0 and then, in one iteration, increase its value by 0.1 until it reaches the value 10.0
At each step the increasing number of the step of the iteration and the new value of the of the variable will be printed.

4b)
Write a variant of the 4a) program which uses a double variable instead of a float.
