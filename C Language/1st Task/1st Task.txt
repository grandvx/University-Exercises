- The square of the first number and the square root of the second number(of the corresponding real number).
No need to consider the probability of dividing by zero.

Write a program that reads the length, in meters, of the edge of a cube and calculates the area and volume of the cube.
Also calculate the area and volume of a sphere with a radius of the same length as the edge of the previous cube.

3)
Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle having as input the lengths of its three sides (real numbers).
